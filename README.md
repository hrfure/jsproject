# jsproject
This project is a simple portfolio website, introducing "Fure," a Norwegian investor and tech enthusiast. The webpage is designed using Bootstrap and contains a navigation bar, images, embedded video, and links to different sections of the portfolio, such as Fure's bio and projects.

**Layout & Components:**
**1. Navigation Bar:**
Titled “Fure’s navbar,” it includes links to the homepage, projects dropdown, and Fure's bio. The projects dropdown has links to various projects hosted on GitHub.
**2. Images & Embedded Video:**
There’s a selfie image and an embedded YouTube video on the landing page.
3. Information Cards: Two cards introduce Fure and present his projects with corresponding links.

**Features:**
Responsive Design: Bootstrap classes are used, making the website responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes.
Navigation Bar: Contains links to various sections and projects, with a responsive dropdown menu.
Interactive Components: Users can navigate to different sections and projects or watch an embedded YouTube video directly.

**Style:**
CSS styling is mainly handled by Bootstrap, with some additional inline styling for images.

**How to View:**
go to https://hrfure.github.io/jsproject to see it in action

**Dependencies:**
The Bootstrap CSS and JS are linked via CDN, so an active internet connection is required to load these resources. Alternatively, you can download these files and link them locally.
The styles.css file should be in the same directory as the HTML file.
Any linked resources like images or other web pages should be available and properly linked.

**Customization & Further Development:**
Styling: Customize styles or add new styles in styles.css to suit your design preferences (a lot that can be done here using templates from Bootstrap etc. - but as the initial project I wanted to code as much as possible myself)
