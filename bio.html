    <p class="text-center">  So who am I?
    I am a Norwegian 36 year old male spending most of his time on investments and now refreshing (feels like starting from scratch) his coding capabilities.
    I have a Msc in Finance from Norwegian School of Managment and Universita Bocconi, I have worked as an investment banker focusing on the Nordic financials sector at DNB and later as a Partner of Magni Partners. I have spent most of my career as an activist investor trying to help grow and improve the companies I invest in - this has often included assuming managment positions or board seats.
